abstract = {Data compression techniques have been the subject of intense study over the past several decades due to exponential increases in the quantity of data stored and transmitted by computer systems. Compression algorithms are traditionally forced to make tradeoffs between throughput and compression quality (the ratio of original file size to compressed file size). FPGAs represent a compelling substrate for streaming applications such as data compression thanks to their capacity for deep pipelines and custom caching solutions. Unfortunately,
data hazards in compression algorithms such as LZ77 inhibit the creation of deep pipelines without sacrificing some amount of compression quality. In this work we detail a scalable fully pipelined FPGA accelerator that performs LZ77 compression and static Huffman encoding at rates up to 5.6 GB/s. Furthermore,
we explore tradeoffs between compression quality and FPGA area that allow the same throughput at a fraction of the logic utilization in exchange for moderate reductions in compression quality. Compared to recent FPGA compression studies,
our emphasis on scalability gives our accelerator a 3.0x advantage in resource utilization at equivalent throughput and compression ratio.},

abstract = {Error-bounded lossy compression is critical to the success of extreme-scale scientific research because of ever-increasing volumes of data produced by today's high-performance computing (HPC) applications. Not only can error-controlled lossy compressors significantly reduce the I/O and storage burden but they can retain high data fidelity for post analysis. Existing state-of-the-art lossy compressors,
however,
generally suffer from relatively low compression and decompression throughput (up to hundreds of megabytes per second on a single CPU core),
which considerably restrict the adoption of lossy compression by many HPC applications especially those with a fairly high data production rate. In this paper,
we propose a highly efficient lossy compression approach based on field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) under the state-of-the-art lossy compression model SZ. Our contributions are fourfold. (1) We adopt a wavefront memory layout to alleviate the data dependency during the prediction for higher-dimensional predictors,
such as the Lorenzo predictor. (2) We propose a co-design framework named waveSZ based on the wavefront memory layout and the characteristics of SZ algorithm and carefully implement it by using high-level synthesis. (3) We propose a hardware-algorithm co-optimization method to improve the performance. (4) We evaluate our proposed waveSZ on three real-world HPC simulation datasets from the Scientific Data Reduction Benchmarks and compare it with other state-of-the-art methods on both CPUs and FPGAs. Experiments show that our waveSZ can improve SZ's compression throughput by 6.9X ~ 8.7X over the production version running on a state-of-the-art CPU and improve the compression ratio and throughput by 2.1X and 5.8X on average,
respectively,
compared with the state-of-the-art FPGA design.},

abstract = {Hardware implementation of lossless data compression is important for optimizing the capacity/cost/power of storage devices in data centers,
as well as communication channels in high-speed networks. In this work we use the Open Computing Language (OpenCL) to implement high-speed data compression (Gzip) on a field-programmable gate-arrays (FPGA). We show how we make use of a heavily-pipelined custom hardware implementation to achieve the high throughput of ~3 GB/s with more than 2x compression ratio over standard compression benchmarks. When compared against a highly-tuned CPU implementation,
the performance-per-watt of our OpenCL FPGA implementation is 12x better and compression ratio is on-par. Additionally,
we compare our implementation to a hand-coded commercial implementation of Gzip to quantify the gap between a high-level language like OpenCL,
and a hardware description language like Verilog. OpenCL performance is 5.3\% lower than Verilog,
and area is 2\% more logic and 25\% more of the FPGA's available memory resources but the productivity gains are significant.},
